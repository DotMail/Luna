# Luna

## What is it?
Luna is the central repository for both stable and nightly builds of the full
DotMail app.

## What do I have to do?
Nothing.  Moonshine takes care of the nitty gritty details.  Maintainers can log in through DotMail to recieve nightlies if they
choose, otherwise only public releases will be downloaded and auto-updated to.
